# Git Two-Branch Exercise (v2): Merge vs Rebase — Sync **into feature** then open PR

This version updates the workflow per instructions:
- **No need for `--no-ff`**.
- For BOTH workflows, **bring `main` into the feature branch first** (merge or rebase),
  then open a PR from `feature` → `main`.

Use the tasks in `tasks/` and validate with `scripts/validate.py`.
Optionally, run `scripts/solution_create_state.sh` to auto-produce a correct end state.
